Design: a 2 condition design, with the following conditions: High & Low Specificity.

LINGUISTIC materials:

The raw materials consist of 96 pairs of high-low noun pairs (192 nouns in total). They are divided into 2 lists. List 1 contains low-spec items for odd-numbered items, and high-spec trials for even-num items, and List 2 vice versa. And each list is divided into 2 subsets. So there are 4 subsets in total.

There are 4 runs for each subjects, each run contains 48 trials. Each trial contain 1 noun, 1 question, and is always followed by an ISI (range from 200-700, with 100 as increment). There are 8 condition orders.

Each type of question (8 in total) appeared exactly 6 times, and YES/NO is balanced within each question too (each question type has exactly 3 YES 3 NO).

Procedure:

We have 192 trials in total, across the four runs.

fixation (duration 250ms)
blank screen (250ms)
word (1,000ms)
blank screen (500ms)
question (max 3,000ms) (the script should take an answer as soon as the q period starts and until the end of the q. period; the image disappear immediately after the participant answers)

After each trial, an additional ISI blank screen will be presented for one of the 6 durations (200ms, 300ms, 400ms, 500ms, 600ms, 700ms).

The full set of 400 trials will be divided into 4 runs, with each run consisting of 48 trials (24 trials for each of the two conditions). The YES/NO is balanced across conditions, so 12 high- yes, 12 high- now, 12 low - yes, and 12 low -no,

Before the start of each run, the instruction for the task will appear on the screen (for max 600sec; in case the participant has questions to ask the experimenter) until the participant press a button to start. At the end of each run, participants have the option of resting for 1 minute. They can skip the rest by pressing any key. Otherwise, the experiment will continue after 1 minute.

Run Duration: 266 sec
